# About the project
**Welcome to my page**

This is the learning diary for the course 'Introduction to Open Data Science 2020'. I would like to further develop my data science skills in **R** programming and get familiar with **Github**.  
*The project repository in GitHub: https://github.com/Imangholiloo/IODS-project*

```{r}
# Let's get the date and time
date()
```
alternatively, `print(Sys.time())`


```{r}
# load package
library(rmarkdown)
```
